Presentation for HPC spartan on Econometrics with Supercomputing online on 2025-10-17

## email 

Please join me this Friday afternoon for my online seminar on: Econometrics with Supercomputing

During this seminar, as a proficient user of our computational resources and a trainer of generations of academics and PhD students, I will:
+ brag about how great unimelb's High-Performance Computing spartan server is,
+ how short it takes to run a job (I'm shocked on these rare occasions when it takes more than a minute bc usually jobs start within seconds thanks to spartan's world-class demand-driven resource allocation system - they actually publish papers on this!),
+ how to get the 700h of computations for your next R&R to get through the server in 7h! (based on a true story),
+ how to make life easier for yourself and workflows using spartan super smooth.

Time: Friday, 17 October, 3pm
